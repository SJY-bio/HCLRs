# HCLRs
Cell-cell communication (CCC) is essential for multicellular life and cellular processes. However, current resources for studying ligand-receptor interactions are often limited and biased. Here, we present HCLRs, a high-confidence ligand-receptor interaction set predicted using HCLRM integrating eight key features, achieving an AUC of 0.98. We benchmarked HCLRs against seven CCC inference methods based on single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, showing its incorporation generally improved predictive performance. HCLRs outperformed most of the 21 existing resources in identifying reliable interactions across varying data resolutions and uncovered prognostic cancer and onco-fetal communications. HCLRs demonstrates strong portability and flexibility across CCC tools, enhancing prediction effectiveness.
